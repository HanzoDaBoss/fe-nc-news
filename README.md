The NC-News app functions as an article-based news platform similar to Reddit. It allows users to explore and read articles, express their preferences through upvoting or downvoting, and engage in discussions by posting or deleting comments. Additionally, users can refine their browsing experience through filtering options.

In addition, a user must choose from a predetermined list of profiles in order to access certain features like commenting.

Head over to the profiles section to choose your preferred user.

This project is designed to outline building the front-end architecture of a full-stack application, which consumes a RESTful API for accessing and storing data.
